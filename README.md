I am a student with a strong interest in software development, specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), as well as proficiency in C++ and Java. I have hands-on experience building a food delivery application and have completed a backend development certification from Udemy, focusing on Express and Node.js.
